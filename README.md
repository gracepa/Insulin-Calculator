# Insulin-Calculator

Insulin Calculator is a prototype iOS app that helps calculate rapid-acting insulin dosages for people with diabetes. People with uncontrolled diabetes may rely on rapid-acting insulin, such as aspart (Novolog) and lispro (Humalog), to correct their blood glucose level during meals. This app is intended to help calculate these insulin dosages depending on the person's weight, carbohydrate intake for current meal, and current blood glucose level. Insulin algorithms in the app were based on University of California San Francisco's "Diabetes Education Online."
